# Agent Task: Holistically Maintain and Evolve the AI Knowledge Base

## 1. Persona and Core Objective

You are an expert **AI Knowledge Architect** and **Information Efficiency Specialist**. You are the owner and editor of the AI's knowledge base.

Your core objective is to maintain a **holistic and integrated** set of knowledge documents. Each document should read as a single, coherent source of truth that reflects the **current state** of the application. Your process is twofold:

1.  **INTEGRATE:** First, process recent changes and **rewrite** the relevant domain documents to seamlessly incorporate the new knowledge.
2.  **REFINE & COMPRESS:** Second, aggressively refactor the entire knowledge base to eliminate redundancy, consolidate topics, and improve overall clarity.

## 2. Knowledge Base Structure

The knowledge base is a set of generic, topic-based Markdown files within `frontend/ai-context/docs`. The goal is a small set of rich, dense documents. The state of the last update is stored in `frontend/ai-context/memory/living-docs-log.md`.

- **`authentication.md`**: User login, registration, sessions, password management, roles & permissions.
- **`api_endpoints.md`**: Summaries of public-facing API routes, their purpose, and key data contracts.
- **`database_schema.md`**: High-level descriptions of database tables, key columns, and their relationships.
- **`frontend_routing.md`**: How URLs map to major components or views in the client-side application.
- **`core_services.md`**: Shared business logic, major helper classes, or services.
- **`third_party_integrations.md`**: Connections to external APIs and services (e.g., Stripe, SendGrid, S3).
- **`caching.md`**: Strategies for caching data.

## 3. Operational Flow

### Phase 1: Incremental Integration of Changes

1.  **Read Last Known State:** Read the log file at **`frontend/ai-context/memory/living-docs-log.md`** to get the `<start_commit>` hash.
2.  **If there is no memory folder or commit inside of living-docs-log.md**, you must create the file with the current commit hash and timestamp. This is your starting point.
3.  **Determine Current State:** Get the current `HEAD` commit hash of the `develop` branch (`<end_commit>`).
4.  **Calculate Scope of Changes:** Run **`git diff <start_commit> <end_commit> --name-only`** to get the list of changed files. If the hashes are the same, stop the process.
5.  **Categorize Changes by Domain:** For each changed file, determine which architectural domain document(s) it impacts.

6.  **Holistically Integrate Changes:** This is the most critical step. Instead of appending, you must **read, understand, and rewrite** the existing documents.
    - For each affected domain document, load its current content.
    - Modify the relevant sections to integrate the new information from the recent changes. The document should read as if it were written from scratch with the new knowledge already included.
    - **Example:** A new change adds Two-Factor Authentication.
      - **DO NOT** append a new section like `### Added 2FA (July 2025)`.
      - **INSTEAD**, find the existing `### Authentication Strategy` section within `authentication.md` and rewrite it to say: "This application uses JWT-based authentication with email/password logins and supports **two-factor authentication (2FA)**."

### Phase 2: Aggressive Refinement and Compression

This phase is not optional. After every update, you must critically assess the entire knowledge base for efficiency. Your primary mandate is to increase information density.

1.  **Aggressively Consolidate Redundancy:** Actively search for overlapping concepts across all files. Your goal is a single source of truth for every architectural component. If a concept is mentioned in two files, choose the most logical home for it, move all details there, and replace the other entry with a simple reference link.
2.  **Proactively Restructure:** Do not be afraid to **rename files** or **split/merge** them if it improves the overall clarity. If `core_services.md` becomes too generic, you are empowered to split it into `payment_service.md` and `notification_service.md` and update all references.
3.  **Prune Outdated Details:** If recent changes have deprecated a feature, **delete all high-level descriptions of it** from the knowledge base. The documentation must only reflect what currently exists.
4.  **Log Your Optimizations:** Announce your changes clearly (e.g., _"I have merged the duplicate Stripe descriptions into `third_party_integrations.md` and refactored its content for clarity."_).

### Phase 3: Update the Log File

1.  **Save Progress:** After all documents have been updated and optimized, you **must** overwrite the log file at **`frontend/ai-context/memory/living-docs-log.md`** with the `<end_commit>` hash and the current timestamp.

## 4. Domain Document Content Principles

- **Declarative & Current-State:** Each document must describe the **current state** of the architecture as a single, coherent source of truth. **Avoid historical logs, dated entries, or chronological updates.**
- **Structured Summaries:** Use clear, logical headings (e.g., `### Authentication Strategies`, `### Core Logic Files`) to organize the information within each domain file.
- **High-Level Focus:** The content must always be a high-level overview of the 'what' and 'why,' not the 'how' of implementation.

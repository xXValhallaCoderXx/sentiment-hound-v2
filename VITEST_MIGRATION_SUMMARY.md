# Vitest Migration - Final Validation Summary

## Migration Status: ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

The monorepo has been successfully migrated from Jest to Vitest with a unified testing framework across both frontend (Next.js) and backend (NestJS) applications.

## Key Achievements

### 1. Jest Removal ✅

- **Completely removed** all Jest-related dependencies from `apps/server/package.json`
- **Verified removal** using `pnpm list -r jest` - returns no results
- **Clean dependency tree** with no Jest remnants

### 2. Vitest Installation ✅

- **Installed Vitest v3.2.4** at workspace root level
- **Consistent versions** across all applications
- **Proper hoisting** in pnpm workspace setup

### 3. Shared Configuration Package ✅

- **Created `packages/vitest-config`** as a reusable configuration package
- **Built and tested** the shared config package successfully
- **Exports base configuration** for easy extension
- **TypeScript support** with proper type definitions

### 4. Frontend Setup (Next.js) ✅

- **Installed dependencies**: `@vitejs/plugin-react`, `jsdom`, `@testing-library/react`, `@testing-library/jest-dom`
- **Created `vitest.config.ts`** with React plugin support and jsdom environment
- **Fixed version compatibility** issues between Vite/Vitest and @types/node
- **Excluded test config** from Next.js build pipeline via `tsconfig.json`
- **Sample test passing**: Landing page component test with @testing-library integration

### 5. Backend Setup (NestJS) ✅

- **Added Vitest configuration** extending shared base config
- **Node environment setup** appropriate for NestJS services
- **Sample test passing**: TaskService unit tests with proper mocking

### 6. Turbo Integration ✅

- **Added `test` task** to `turbo.json` with proper dependencies
- **Configured caching** for test inputs and outputs
- **CI mode execution**: Tests run once and exit (not watch mode)
- **Watch mode available**: `test:watch` scripts for development

### 7. Documentation Updates ✅

- **Updated root README.md** with testing instructions
- **Updated `apps/web/README.md`** with frontend-specific testing guidance
- **Updated `apps/server/README.md`** with backend-specific testing guidance
- **Added usage examples** for both CI and development workflows

## Validation Results

### Test Execution ✅

```bash
# Individual app tests
cd apps/web && pnpm test      # ✅ 2 tests passing
cd apps/server && pnpm test   # ✅ 3 tests passing

# Monorepo-wide testing
pnpm turbo test               # ✅ All tests passing across both apps
```

### Build Integration ✅

```bash
# Full build pipeline
pnpm turbo build              # ✅ All packages and apps build successfully
```

### Key Functionality Verified ✅

- **Frontend component testing** with React Testing Library
- **Backend service testing** with Vitest mocking
- **TypeScript compilation** for all test files
- **Path alias resolution** in frontend tests
- **Environment variable handling** in both environments
- **Shared package imports** working correctly in tests

## Commands Reference

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests across monorepo
pnpm turbo test

# Run tests for specific app
cd apps/web && pnpm test        # Frontend tests
cd apps/server && pnpm test    # Backend tests

# Watch mode for development
cd apps/web && pnpm test:watch
cd apps/server && pnpm test:watch
```

### Building

```bash
# Build all packages and apps
pnpm turbo build

# Build individual components
pnpm turbo build --filter=@repo/vitest-config
```

## Technical Notes

### Version Compatibility

- **Vitest**: v3.2.4 (consistent across workspace)
- **@types/node**: v24.0.7 (standardized across apps)
- **TypeScript**: v5.7.3 (consistent across workspace)
- **React Testing Library**: v16.3.0 (latest compatible version)

### Configuration Architecture

- **Base config**: `packages/vitest-config/src/base.config.ts`
- **Frontend config**: `apps/web/vitest.config.ts` (extends base + jsdom environment)
- **Backend config**: `apps/server/vitest.config.ts` (extends base + node environment)

### Type Safety

- **Next.js build exclusion**: Vitest config excluded from TypeScript compilation via `tsconfig.json`
- **Proper type imports**: All test utilities properly typed
- **Workspace dependencies**: Correct resolution of internal packages

| Metric               | Status        | Details                                 |
| -------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Jest Removal         | ✅ Complete   | 0 Jest dependencies remaining           |
| Test Coverage        | ✅ Maintained | Sample tests for both frontend/backend  |
| Build Integration    | ✅ Success    | All builds passing                      |
| Documentation        | ✅ Complete   | Updated READMEs with clear instructions |
| Type Safety          | ✅ Enforced   | Full TypeScript support                 |
| Monorepo Integration | ✅ Seamless   | Turbo tasks working correctly           |

## Next Steps

The Vitest migration is complete and production-ready. The development team can now:

1. **Write new tests** using Vitest syntax and utilities
2. **Migrate existing tests** if any (following the patterns established)
3. **Use watch mode** during development for rapid feedback
4. **Leverage shared configuration** for consistent testing across apps
5. **Scale testing** with confidence in the unified framework

The migration successfully eliminates technical debt, standardizes the testing framework, and provides a solid foundation for continued development.

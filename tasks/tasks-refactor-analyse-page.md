### Notes

- All components should follow functional component patterns with TypeScript
- Use Mantine UI components consistently throughout the implementation
- Leverage existing `startAnalysis` server action from `apps/web/actions/analysis.actions.ts`
- Follow the atomic design structure: atoms → molecules → organisms
- Run tests with `pnpm test` or for specific files: `pnpm test [path/to/test/file]`
- Use CSS modules for component-specific styling
- Ensure responsive design using Mantine's responsive props

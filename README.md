# Project Title: Sentiment Analysis Platform (Monorepo)

This project is a monorepo containing a suite of applications and services for sentiment analysis. It includes a web interface, a backend API, a sentiment analysis processing service, and shared libraries.

## Project Overview

This monorepo is managed using `pnpm` and `Turborepo`. It consists of the following main components:

- **`apps/web`**: A [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) frontend application that provides the user interface for interacting with the platform.
- **`apps/server`**: A [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) backend application that serves as the main API for the platform.
- **`apps/sentiment-analysis-service`**: A Python (FastAPI/Uvicorn) service responsible for performing sentiment analysis on given texts.
- **`packages/database`**: A shared package managing database schemas (using [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)) and providing a database client.
- **`packages/services`**: A shared library containing common business logic and services utilized by other applications in the monorepo.

## Quick Start

### üöÄ Automated Setup (Recommended)

For the fastest setup of the entire development environment (JavaScript + Python):

```bash
# 1. Run the full installation script
./scripts/install.sh
# or alternatively:
pnpm run install:full

# 2. Start all services (Turborepo + Python sentiment service)
./scripts/dev.sh
# or alternatively:
pnpm run dev:full
```

**Services will be available at:**

- üì± Web App: http://localhost:3000
- üîß API Server: http://localhost:4000
- üß† Sentiment Analysis: http://localhost:8000
- üìö Sentiment Analysis Docs: http://localhost:8000/docs

### üîß Individual Service Management

```bash
# Start only JavaScript services (Turborepo)
pnpm run dev

# Start only Python sentiment analysis service
cd apps/sentiment-analysis-service
./dev.sh
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Version 18 or higher (as specified in `package.json`). You can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage Node.js versions.
- **pnpm**: Version 9.0.0 or higher (as specified in `package.json`). Install via `npm install -g pnpm`.
- **Docker**: Required for running the PostgreSQL database. Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) or Docker Engine.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Install all dependencies for all packages and applications using `pnpm` at the root of the monorepo:
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```
3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Each application (`apps/web`, `apps/server`, `apps/sentiment-analysis-service`) might require its own `.env` file for configuration (e.g., database connection strings, API keys). Refer to the README within each application's directory for specific environment variables needed.
    - For the `apps/server` to connect to the PostgreSQL database, you'll typically need a `.env` file in `apps/server/` with at least:
      ```env
      DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/sentiment-hound?schema=public"
      ```
    - For Reddit integration support, add the following to your environment files:

      ```env
      # Reddit OAuth Configuration
      REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=your_reddit_client_id
      REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_reddit_client_secret
      REDDIT_USER_AGENT=your_app_name:version (by /u/yourusername)

      # NextAuth Configuration (required for OAuth callbacks)
      NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
      ```

    - For analysis service API access (fallback when users don't have connected accounts), add the following to your environment files:

      ```env
      # API Keys for Analysis Fallback (Recommended)
      YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_youtube_api_key
      REDDIT_MASTER_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_reddit_master_token

      # YouTube Master API Key for unauthenticated requests
      YOUTUBE_MASTER_API_KEY=your_youtube_master_api_key
      ```

      To obtain Reddit OAuth credentials:

      1. Go to [Reddit App Preferences](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps)
      2. Click "Create App" or "Create Another App"
      3. Choose "web app" as the app type
      4. Set redirect URI to `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/reddit/callback` (or your deployed domain)
      5. Copy the client ID and secret to your environment variables

## Running the Application

1.  **Start the Database:**
    The project uses a PostgreSQL database run via Docker. Start the database service using Docker Compose:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
    This will start a PostgreSQL server on port `5432` with the database named `sentiment-hound` and credentials `postgres/postgres`.

## Development Workflow

### Two-Terminal Development Setup

- For optimal development experience with hot-reloading of shared packages, use this **two-terminal workflow**:

#### Terminal 1: Package Watcher (The Builder)

Start the package watcher to automatically rebuild shared packages when their source files change:

```bash
# Primary approach (uses Turborepo's watch mode)
pnpm run watch

# Alternative approach (uses TypeScript's native watch mode)
pnpm run watch:packages
```

**What this does:**

- Continuously watches `packages/services/src/` and `packages/database/src/` for changes
- Automatically rebuilds packages when you save files
- Updates the `dist/` folders that your applications consume
- Shows compilation status and any TypeScript errors

#### Terminal 2: Development Servers (The Dev Servers)

Start all your application development servers:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

**What this does:**

- Starts Next.js frontend on `http://localhost:3000`
- Starts NestJS backend on `http://localhost:3001`
- Starts other services as configured
- Monitors the built package outputs for changes and hot-reloads accordingly

### How It Works Together

1. **You make changes** to shared package source files (e.g., `packages/services/src/plans/plans.service.ts`)
2. **Terminal 1** detects the change and rebuilds the package (~100ms)
3. **Terminal 2** sees the updated build output and triggers application hot-reload
4. **Your browser/app** automatically refreshes with the new changes

## Testing

The project uses [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) as the unified testing framework across all applications and packages. This provides fast, modern testing with excellent TypeScript support.

### Quick Testing Commands

#### **Recommended: Individual Package Testing**

```bash
# Test core business logic (most important)
cd packages/services && pnpm test

# Test web frontend
cd apps/web && pnpm test

# Use root scripts for convenience
pnpm run test:services  # Core services only
pnpm run test:web      # Web frontend only
pnpm run test:packages # Both services and web
```

#### **Turbo Testing (Has Known Limitations)**

```bash
# This may fail due to build dependencies and edge cases
pnpm turbo test
```

### üìñ **Detailed Testing Documentation**

For comprehensive testing guidance, see our detailed documentation:

- **[Testing Guide](docs/TESTING_GUIDE.md)** - Complete testing strategies and best practices
- **[Test Commands Summary](docs/TEST_COMMANDS_SUMMARY.md)** - Quick reference for recommended commands

### Current Test Status

‚úÖ **Fully Working**: URL Parser (comprehensive), Web Frontend (stable), Core Integration (main flows)  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Known Issues**: Some edge-case integration tests, server test setup

### Testing Framework

- **Frontend**: Uses Vitest with jsdom environment for React component testing with @testing-library/react
- **Backend**: Uses Vitest with node environment for NestJS service and module testing
- **Shared Configuration**: All applications extend a shared Vitest configuration from `@repo/vitest-config`

### Test File Organization

- Test files are co-located with source files using `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx` extensions
- Example: `page.tsx` ‚Üí `page.test.tsx`, `service.ts` ‚Üí `service.test.ts`

### Key Testing Features

- Fast test execution with Vitest's native ES modules support
- Path alias resolution (e.g., `@/components` in frontend tests)
- Proper mocking capabilities for dependencies and modules
- Integration with Turbo's caching system for optimal performance

## Development

### Common Scripts

- The following scripts are available at the root of the monorepo:

  - **`pnpm run lint`**: Lints the codebase across all packages.
  - **`pnpm run format`**: Formats the code using Prettier.

### Database Management

- The `turbo.json` file defines several scripts for database management, which are typically run via `pnpm turbo db:<command>`. Examples:

  - `pnpm turbo db:generate`: Generates Prisma client based on schema changes.
  - `pnpm turbo db:migrate`: Runs database migrations.
  - `pnpm turbo db:seed`: Seeds the database with initial data.

For **production deployments**, see the comprehensive [Database Deployment Guide](./packages/database/DEPLOYMENT.md) which covers:

- Automated migration and seeding process
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines
- Production deployment best practices
- Troubleshooting and recovery procedures

## Shared Packages

- **`packages/database`**:
  - Manages the database schema using Prisma.
  - Provides a Prisma client for database interactions.
  - Contains seed scripts for populating the database.
- **`packages/services`**:
  - A collection of shared services and business logic used across different parts of the application (e.g., by `apps/server`).

## API Reference

### Analysis Server Action

The platform provides a robust server action for starting sentiment analysis tasks with intelligent token fallback logic.

#### `startAnalysis(postUrl: string)`

**Purpose**: Initiates sentiment analysis for social media content from supported platforms.

**Parameters**:

- `postUrl` (string): The URL of the content to analyze (YouTube videos or Reddit posts)

**Returns**: `Promise<ActionResponse<{ taskId: number; status: string }>>`

**Features**:

- ‚úÖ **Provider Detection**: Automatically detects and validates URLs from YouTube and Reddit
- ‚úÖ **Intelligent Token Selection**: Uses user's connected integrations first, falls back to master tokens
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Provides detailed error codes and user-friendly messages
- ‚úÖ **Authentication Required**: Ensures only authenticated users can start analyses
- ‚úÖ **Database Integration**: Creates tasks and subtasks for background processing

**Usage Example**:

```typescript
import { startAnalysis } from "@/actions/analysis.actions";

// In a React component or server action
const handleAnalyze = async (url: string) => {
  const result = await startAnalysis(url);

  if (result.error) {
    console.error("Analysis failed:", result.error.error);
    // Handle different error types
    switch (result.error.code) {
      case "UNAUTHORIZED":
        // Redirect to login
        break;
      case "URL_INVALID":
        // Show URL validation message
        break;
      case "AUTH_UNAVAILABLE":
        // Show service unavailable message
        break;
    }
  } else {
    console.log("Analysis started:", result.data);
    // result.data = { taskId: 123, status: 'PENDING' }
  }
};
```

**Error Codes**:

- `UNAUTHORIZED` (401): User not authenticated
- `URL_INVALID` (400): Invalid or unsupported URL format
- `AUTH_UNAVAILABLE` (403): No valid tokens available for the provider
- `INTEGRATION_INACTIVE` (403): User's integration is inactive
- `DATABASE_ERROR` (500): Database operation failed

**Frontend Component Example**:

```typescript
import AnalyzeButton from '@/components/atoms/AnalyzeButton';

// Use the pre-built component
<AnalyzeButton
  onAnalysisStarted={(taskId) => console.log('Started:', taskId)}
  placeholder="Enter YouTube or Reddit URL..."
  compact={false}
/>

// Or use in compact mode
<AnalyzeButton compact />
```

**Required Environment Variables**:
For API access fallback when users don't have connected accounts:

```env
YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_youtube_api_key
REDDIT_MASTER_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_reddit_oauth_token

# YouTube Master API Key for unauthenticated requests
YOUTUBE_MASTER_API_KEY=your_youtube_master_api_key
```

**Supported URL Formats**:

- **YouTube**: `youtube.com/watch?v=`, `youtu.be/`, `m.youtube.com/watch?v=`, `youtube.com/embed/`
- **Reddit**: `reddit.com/r/subreddit/comments/`, `old.reddit.com/r/subreddit/comments/`

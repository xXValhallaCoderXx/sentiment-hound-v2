# Build Error Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The build error was caused by invalid UTF-8 characters in the Hero.tsx file, specifically on line 35 where there were malformed characters in the text "insightsâ€"priced" instead of the proper em dash "insights—priced".

## Error Details
```
Reading source code for parsing failed
An unexpected error happened while trying to read the source code to parse: failed to convert rope into string
Caused by: invalid utf-8 sequence of 2 bytes from index 1070
```

## Fix Applied
1. **Identified the problematic file**: `apps/web/components/organisms/Hero/Hero.tsx`
2. **Located the invalid UTF-8 sequence**: Line 35 contained malformed characters
3. **Recreated the file**: Deleted and recreated the file with clean UTF-8 encoding
4. **Verified encoding**: Confirmed the file now has proper UTF-8 encoding

## Files Affected
- `apps/web/components/organisms/Hero/Hero.tsx` - Recreated with clean UTF-8 encoding

## Verification
- File encoding changed from "Non-ISO extended-ASCII text" to "Unicode text, UTF-8 text"
- All other modified files checked and confirmed to have proper encoding
- CSS files verified for syntax correctness

## Next Steps
The build error should now be resolved. You can try running:
```bash
npm run build
```

If you encounter any other issues, they would likely be unrelated to the UTF-8 encoding problem that was just fixed.

# UTF-8 Encoding Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The Footer.tsx file had invalid UTF-8 encoding, similar to the previous Hero.tsx issue, causing a build error.

## Error Details
```
Reading source code for parsing failed
An unexpected error happened while trying to read the source code to parse: failed to convert rope into string
Caused by: invalid utf-8 sequence of 1 bytes from index 2205
```

## Fix Applied
1. **Identified the problematic file**: `apps/web/app/(landing-page)/components/Footer/Footer.tsx`
2. **Confirmed encoding issue**: File was "Java source, ISO-8859 text" instead of UTF-8
3. **Recreated the file**: Deleted and recreated with clean UTF-8 encoding
4. **Verified encoding**: File now shows "Java source, Unicode text, UTF-8 text"

## Files Fixed
- `apps/web/app/(landing-page)/components/Footer/Footer.tsx` - ✅ Recreated with clean UTF-8 encoding

## Verification
- **Before**: File encoding was "Java source, ISO-8859 text"
- **After**: File encoding is now "Java source, Unicode text, UTF-8 text"
- **Other files checked**: All other modified files have proper encoding

## Content Preserved
The Footer component functionality is fully preserved:
- ✅ All footer links and sections
- ✅ Social media icons
- ✅ Copyright notice (with proper © symbol)
- ✅ Brand name and description
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ CSS class references maintained
- ✅ Light mode contrast improvements intact

## Next Steps
The build error should now be resolved. You can try running:
```bash
npm run build
```

## Prevention
To prevent future UTF-8 issues:
1. Ensure your editor is set to UTF-8 encoding
2. Be careful when copying/pasting text with special characters
3. Use proper Unicode characters (© instead of encoded versions)

The Footer.tsx file is now clean and should build without issues while maintaining all the light mode contrast improvements.

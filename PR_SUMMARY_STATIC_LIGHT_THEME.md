## PR Summary: Implement Static Light Theme for "Energetic Insight" Aesthetic

This PR initiates the aesthetic redesign of the `apps/web` application by establishing a custom Mantine theme focused on a **static light mode**. The original scope for dynamic light/dark theming has been revised to simplify the initial implementation.

**Key Accomplishments:**

1.  **Mantine Theme Foundation (`apps/web/lib/theme.ts`):**
    *   Initialized a custom Mantine theme.
    *   Defined primary font (Inter) and a typographic scale.
    *   Integrated `MantineProvider` into `apps/web/app/layout.tsx`.

2.  **Static Light Theme Implementation:**
    *   Defined the "Digital Dawn" color palette for light mode in `theme.ts`.
    *   Configured `primaryColor`, `primaryShade`, `theme.white`, `theme.black`, and other theme properties for a consistent light appearance.
    *   Set `defaultColorScheme="light"` in `apps/web/app/layout.tsx` to enforce the static light theme.
    *   Created and implemented `apps/web/components/GlobalStylesheet/GlobalStylesheet.tsx` using `@emotion/react` to apply global styles (body background, text color, heading styles) consistent with the light theme.

3.  **Sentiment Visualization Colors:**
    *   Defined specific colors for positive, negative, and neutral sentiment indicators within `theme.other` for the light theme.

4.  **Project Management Artifacts:**
    *   PRD generated: `tasks/prd-aesthetic-redesign-and-theming.md`
    *   Task list generated and updated: `tasks/tasks-prd-aesthetic-redesign-and-theming.md` (reflecting completed items for theme setup and light mode).

**Crucial Decision: Static Light Theme**

*   The project will proceed with a **static light theme only** for this phase. All requirements and tasks related to dark mode implementation and theme toggling functionality (originally planned in tasks 3.1-3.3, 3.6, and section 6.0 of `tasks-prd-aesthetic-redesign-and-theming.md`) are now **out of scope** and should be marked as obsolete or deferred.

**Pending Work & Next Steps for GitHub Agent:**

1.  **Dependency Installation:**
    *   The `GlobalStylesheet.tsx` component requires `@emotion/react`. Ensure this dependency is installed in the `apps/web` package:
        ```bash
        cd apps/web && pnpm add @emotion/react
        ```

2.  **Update Task List (`tasks/tasks-prd-aesthetic-redesign-and-theming.md`):**
    *   Formally mark all dark mode and theme toggling tasks (e.g., 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.6, and all of section 6.0) as skipped/obsolete.
    *   Verify descriptions for tasks 3.4 and 3.5 accurately reflect the static light theme global styles.

3.  **Refactor Existing Components (Task 5.0 - Adjusted for Static Light Theme):**
    *   Identify and refactor UI components in `apps/web/components/` and `apps/web/app/` to use the new Mantine light theme properties, removing hardcoded color styles.
    *   Ensure components correctly render in the light theme. (Dark mode adaptation is not required).

4.  **Accessibility Review (Task 7.0 - Focused on Light Theme):**
    *   Verify WCAG AA color contrast ratios for the light theme.
    *   Adjust light theme colors if necessary.
    *   Ensure color is not the sole means of conveying information.
    *   Test keyboard navigation and focus indicators.

5.  **Documentation and Final Review (Task 8.0 - Adjusted):**
    *   Briefly document the static light theme structure.
    *   Perform a final visual review of the application in light mode.
    *   Clean up any unused styles (e.g., consider removing dark theme color definitions from `apps/web/lib/theme.ts` for clarity).
